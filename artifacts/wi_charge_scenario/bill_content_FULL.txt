17
SEC. 1271. SHORT TITLE.
18 This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Western Balkans
19 Democracy and Prosperity Act’’.
20
SEC. 1272. FINDINGS.
21 Congress finds the following:
22 (1) The Western Balkans countries (the Repub-
23 lic of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic
24 of Kosovo, Montenegro, the Republic of North Mac-
25 edonia and the Republic of Serbia) form a plural-
†S 2296 ES

955
1 istic, multi-ethnic region in the heart of Europe that
2 is critical to the peace, stability, and prosperity of
3 that continent.
4 (2) Continued peace, stability, and prosperity in
5 the Western Balkans is directly tied to the opportu-
6 nities for democratic and economic advancement
7 available to the citizens and residents of those six
8 countries.
9 (3) It is in the mutual interest of the United
10 States and the countries of the Western Balkans to
11 promote stable and sustainable economic growth and
12 development in the region.
13 (4) The reforms and integration with the Euro-
14 pean Union pursued by countries in the Western
15 Balkans have led to significant democratic and eco-
16 nomic progress in the region.
17 (5) Despite economic progress, rates of poverty
18 and unemployment in the Western Balkans remain
19 higher than in neighboring European Union coun-
20 tries.
21 (6) Out-migration, particularly of youth, is af-
22 fecting demographics in each Western Balkans coun-
23 try, resulting in population decline in all six coun-
24 tries.
†S 2296 ES

956
1 (7) Implementing critical economic and govern-
2 ance reforms could help enable investment and em-
3 ployment opportunities in the Western Balkans, es-
4 pecially for youth, and can provide powerful tools for
5 economic development and for encouraging broader
6 participation in a political process that increases
7 prosperity for all.
8 (8) Existing regional economic efforts, such as
9 the Common Regional Market, the Berlin Process,
10 and the Open Balkan Initiative, could have the po-
11 tential to improve the economic conditions in the
12 Western Balkans, while promoting inclusion and
13 transparency.
14 (9) The Department of Commerce, through its
15 Foreign Commercial Service, plays an important role
16 in promoting and facilitating opportunities for
17 United States investment.
18 (10) Corruption, including among key political
19 leaders, continues to plague the Western Balkans
20 and represents one of the greatest impediments to
21 further economic and political development in the re-
22 gion.
23 (11) Disinformation campaigns targeting the
24 Western Balkans undermine the credibility of its
†S 2296 ES

957
1 democratic institutions, including the integrity of its
2 elections.
3 (12) Vulnerability to cyberattacks or attacks on
4 information and communication technology infra-
5 structure increases risks to the functioning of gov-
6 ernment and the delivery of public services.
7 (13) United States Cyber Command, the De-
8 partment of State, and other Federal agencies play
9 a critical role in defending the national security in-
10 terests of the United States, including by deploying
11 cyber hunt forward teams at the request of partner
12 nations to reinforce their cyber defenses.
13 (14) Securing domestic and international cyber
14 networks and ICT infrastructure is a national secu-
15 rity priority for the United States, which is exempli-
16 fied by offices and programs across the Federal Gov-
17 ernment that support cybersecurity.
18 (15) Corruption and disinformation proliferate
19 in political environments marked by autocratic con-
20 trol or partisan conflict.
21 (16) Dependence on Russian sources of fossil
22 fuels and natural gas for the countries of the West-
23 ern Balkans ties their economies and politics to the
24 Russian Federation and inhibits their aspirations for
25 European integration.
†S 2296 ES

958
1 (17) Reducing the reliance of the Western Bal-
2 kans on Russian natural gas supplies and fossil fuels
3 is in the national interest of the United States.
4 (18) The growing influence of China in the
5 Western Balkans could also have a deleterious im-
6 pact on strategic competition, democracy, and eco-
7 nomic integration with Europe.
8 (19) In March 2022, President Biden launched
9 the European Democratic Resilience Initiative to
10 bolster democratic resilience, advance anti-corruption
11 efforts, and defend human rights in Ukraine and its
12 neighbors in response to Russia’s war of aggression.
13 (20) The parliamentary and local elections held
14 in Serbia on December 17, 2023, and their imme-
15 diate aftermath are cause for deep concern about the
16 state of Serbia’s democracy, including due to the
17 final report of the Organization for Security and Co-
18 operation in Europe’s Office for Democratic Institu-
19 tions and Human Rights, which—
20 (A) found ‘‘unjust conditions’’ for the elec-
21 tion;
22 (B) found ‘‘numerous procedural defi-
23 ciencies, including inconsistent application of
24 safeguards during voting and counting, fre-
25 quent instances of overcrowding, breaches in se-
†S 2296 ES

959
1 crecy of the vote, and numerous instances of
2 group voting’’; and
3 (C) asserted that ‘‘voting must be re-
4 peated’’ in certain polling stations.
5 (21) The Organization for Security and Co-op-
6 eration in Europe also noted that Serbian officials
7 accused primarily peaceful protestors, opposition
8 parties, and civil society of ‘‘attempting to desta-
9 bilize the government’’, a concerning allegation that
10 threatens the safety of important elements of Ser-
11 bian society.
12 (22) Democratic countries whose values are in
13 alignment with the United States make for stronger
14 and more durable partnerships.
15
SEC. 1273. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
16 It is a sense of Congress that the United States
17 should—
18 (1) encourage increased business links and in-
19 vestment between the United States and allies and
20 partners in the Western Balkans;
21 (2) expand United States assistance to regional
22 integration efforts in the Western Balkans;
23 (3) strengthen and expand regional economic
24 integration in the Western Balkans, especially enter-
25 prises owned by and employing women and youth;

3 sification, democratic and economic reform, and the
4 reduction of poverty in the Western Balkans;

6 investment with the Western Balkans, particularly in
7 ways that support countries’ efforts—

11 ciency, and conservation; and
12 (C) to facilitate the transition to cleaner
13 and more reliable sources of energy, including
14 renewables, as appropriate;
15 (6) continue to assist in the development, with-
16 in the Western Balkans, of—
17 (A) strong civil societies;
18 (B) public-private partnerships;
19 (C) independent media;

21 sponsive governance, including equal represen-

7 and recognize the languages, of the Western Bal-

16 host country government to develop new national
17 anti-corruption strategies;

SEC. 1272. FINDINGS.
10 Congress makes the following findings:
11 (1) The People’s Republic of China, the Rus-
12 sian Federation, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and
13 the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are each
14 considered—
15 (A) a foreign adversary (as defined in sec-
16 tion 825(d) of the National Defense Authoriza-
17 tion Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law
18 118–31; 137 Stat. 322; 46 U.S.C. 50309

20 (B) a country of risk (as defined in section

22 Improvement and National Defense Authoriza-
23 tion Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law
24 118–159; 138 Stat. 2488; 42 U.S.C. 7144b
25 note)) for purposes of assessing counterintel-
†S 2296 ES

1056
1 ligence risks posed by certain visitors to Na-
2 tional Laboratories;
3 (C) a foreign country of concern (as de-
4 fined in section 10612(a) of the Research and
5 Development, Competition, and Innovation Act
6 (Public Law 117–167; 136 Stat. 1635; 42
7 U.S.C. 19221 note));
8 (D) a covered foreign country (as defined
9 in section 164 of the Servicemember Quality of
10 Life Improvement and National Defense Au-
11 thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public
12 Law 118159; 138 Stat. 1818; 10 U.S.C. 4651
13 note prec.)) for purposes of a prohibition on op-
14 eration, procurement, and contracting relating
15 to foreign-made light detection and ranging
16 technology; and
17 (E) a covered foreign country (as defined
18 in section 1622 of the National Defense Au-
19 thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Public
20 Law 11781; 135 Stat. 2086; 10 U.S.C. 421
21 note prec.)) for purposes of a strategy and plan
22 to implement certain defense intelligence re-
23 forms.
24 (2) According to the 2025 Intelligence Commu-
25 nity Annual Threat Assessment, the United States
†S 2296 ES

1057
1 faces an increasingly contested and dangerous global
2 landscape as the four adversaries named in para-
3 graph (1) deepen cooperation in a manner that—
4 (A) reinforces threats posed by each such
5 adversary individually; and
6 (B) poses new challenges to the strength
7 and power of the United States globally.
8 (3) Much of the cooperation referred to in para-
9 graph (2) is occurring bilaterally, as the People’s
10 Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the Is-
11 lamic Republic of Iran, and the Democratic People’s
12 Republic of Korea strengthen diplomatic, economic,
13 and military ties in accordance with bilateral agree-
14 ments, which include—
15 (A) the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation
16 and Mutual Assistance between China and the
17 Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, signed
18 at Beijing July 11, 1961;
19 (B) the Joint Statement on Comprehensive
20 Strategic Partnership between the Islamic Re-
21 public of Iran and the People’s Republic of
22 China, issued on March 27, 2021;
23 (C) the Joint Statement of the Russian
24 Federation and the People’s Republic of China
25 on International Relations Entering a New Era
†S 2296 ES

1058
1 and Global Sustainable Development, issued on
2 February 4, 2022;
3 (D) the Treaty on Comprehensive Stra-
4 tegic Partnership between the Russian Federa-
5 tion and the Democratic People’s Republic of
6 Korea, signed at Pyongyang June 18, 2024;
7 (E) the Iranian-Russian Treaty on Com-
8 prehensive Strategic Partnership, signed at
9 Moscow January 17, 2025; and
10 (F) traditional relations of friendship and
11 cooperation between the Islamic Republic of
12 Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of
13 Korea.
14 (4) The most concerning forms of such coopera-
15 tion with respect to the interests of the United
16 States occur bilaterally in the realm of defense co-
17 operation. Examples include the following:
18 (A) TRANSFER AND SHARING OF WEAPONS
19 AND MUNITIONS.—Since 2022, the Islamic Re-
20 public of Iran has supplied the Russian Federa-
21 tion with drones and ballistic missiles, and the
22 Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has pro-
23 vided artillery ammunition and ballistic mis-
24 siles. Likewise, the Russian Federation has
25 agreed to provide the Islamic Republic of Iran
†S 2296 ES

1059
1 with Su–35 fighter jets and air defense assist-
2 ance.
3 (B) TRANSFER AND SHARING OF DUAL-
4 USE TECHNOLOGIES AND CAPABILITIES.—Dual-
5 use goods supplied by the People’s Republic of
6 China have enabled the Russian Federation to
7 continue defense production in the face of wide-
8 ranging sanctions and export controls intended
9 to prevent the Russian Federation from access-
10 ing the necessary components to fuel its defense
11 industry. In turn, reporting indicates that the
12 Russian Federation has provided technical ex-
13 pertise on satellite technology to the Democratic
14 People’s Republic of Korea and is working
15 closely with the People’s Republic of China on
16 air defense and submarine technology.
17 (C) JOINT MILITARY ACTIVITIES AND EX-
18 ERCISES.—The military forces of the Demo-
19 cratic People’s Republic of Korea are actively
20 participating in the Russian Federation’s inva-
21 sion of Ukraine, and joint military exercises be-
22 tween the People’s Republic of China and the
23 Russian Federation are expanding in scope,
24 scale, and geographic reach, including in close
25 proximity to territory of the United States.
†S 2296 ES

1060
1 (D) COORDINATION.—Coordination on
2 disinformation and cyber operations, including
3 coordinated messaging aimed at denigrating
4 and isolating the United States internationally.
5 (5) Adversaries of the United States are also
6 cooperating in a manner that may circumvent
7 United States and multilateral economic tools. Ex-
8 amples include the following:
9 (A) The continued purchase by the Peo-
10 ple’s Republic of China of oil from the Islamic
11 Republic of Iran despite sanctions imposed by
12 the Treasury of the United States on oil from
13 the Islamic Republic of Iran.
14 (B) The veto by the Russian Federation
15 of, and abstention by the People’s Republic of
16 China in a vote on, a United Nations Security
17 Council resolution relating to monitoring United
18 Nations Security Council-levied sanctions on the
19 Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
20 (6) Adversaries of the United States are cooper-
21 ating multilaterally in international institutions such
22 as the United Nations and through expanded multi-
23 lateral groupings, such as the Brazil-Russia-India-
24 China-South Africa group (commonly known as
†S 2296 ES

1061
1 ‘‘BRICS’’), to isolate and erode the influence of the
2 United States.
3 (7) Such increased cooperation and alignment
4 among the People’s Republic of China, the Russian
5 Federation, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the
6 Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to an un-
7 precedented extent, poses a significant threat to
8 United States interests and national security.
9 (8) Such increasing alignment—
10 (A) allows each such adversary to mod-
11 ernize its military more quickly than previously
12 anticipated;
13 (B) enables unforeseen breakthroughs in
14 capabilities through the sharing among such ad-
15 versaries of critical military technologies, which
16 could erode the technological edge of the United
17 States Armed Forces;
18 (C) presents increasing challenges to strat-
19 egies of isolation or containment against such
20 individual adversaries, since the People’s Re-
21 public of China, the Russian Federation, the Is-
22 lamic Republic of Iran, and the Democratic
23 People’s Republic of Korea now provide critical
24 lifelines to each other;
†S 2296 ES

1062
1 (D) threatens the effectiveness of United
2 States economic tools, as such adversaries co-
3 operate to evade United States sanctions and
4 export controls and seek to establish alternative
5 payment mechanisms that do not require trans-
6 actions in United States dollars; and
7 (E) increases the chances of United States
8 conflict or tensions with any one of such adver-
9 saries drawing in another, thereby posing a
10 greater risk that the United States will have to
11 contend with simultaneous threats from such
12 adversaries in one or more theaters.
13
SEC. 1273. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
14 It is the policy of the United States—
15 (1) to disrupt or frustrate the most dangerous
16 aspects of cooperation between and among the Peo-
17 ple’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the
18 Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Democratic Peo-
19 ple’s Republic of Korea, including by using the
20 threat of sanctions and export controls, bringing
21 such cooperation to light, and sharing information
22 with United States allies and partners who may—
23 (A) share the concerns and objectives of
24 the United States; and
25 (B) have influence over such adversaries;
†S 2296 ES

1063
1 (2) to constrain such grouping from expanding
2 its footprint or capabilities across the world; and
3 (3) to prepare for the increasing likelihood that
4 the United States could face simultaneous challenges
5 or conflict with multiple such adversaries in multiple
6 theaters, including by bolstering deterrence across
7 all priority theaters.

21 It is the sense of Congress that—

24 that United States persons, including small busi-
25 nesses, startups, and universities, are in the best po-
†S 2296 ES

1 sition to innovate and harness the potential of artifi-
2 cial intelligence;
3 (2) the demand for advanced artificial intel-
4 ligence chips far exceeds the supply, and United
5 States persons are forced to wait many months, if
6 not longer, to acquire the latest chips;
7 (3) at the same time, United States chip devel-
8 opers are selling advanced artificial intelligence chips
9 to entities in countries that are subject to a United
10 States arms embargo or countries that have a close
11 relationship with such countries, so that United
12 States persons are unable to acquire such chips;
13 (4) the production of such chips for sale to enti-
14 ties in countries described in paragraph (3) is taking
15 up production capacity that would otherwise be used
16 to fabricate chips for United States persons; and
17 (5) it should be the policy of the United States
18 and the Department of Commerce—
19 (A) to deny licenses for the export of the
20 most powerful artificial intelligence chips, in-
21 cluding such chips with a total processing power
22 of 4,800 or above; and
23 (B) to restrict the export of less advanced
24 artificial intelligence chips to foreign entities in
25 countries of concern so long as United States

SEC. 6232. STRATEGY TO RESPOND TO THE PRC’S GLOBAL
2
BASING INTENTIONS.
3 (a) SHORT TITLES.—This section may be cited as the
4 ‘‘Combating PRC Overseas and Unlawful Networked
5 Threats through Enhanced Resilience Act of 2025’’ or the
6 ‘‘COUNTER Act of 2025’’.
7 (b) FINDINGS.—According to multiple sources, in-
8 cluding the 2024 annual report to Congress, titled ‘‘Mili-
9 tary and Security Developments Involving the People’s
10 Republic of China’’ and known informally as the ‘‘China
11 Military Power Report’’—
12 (1) the PRC is seeking to expand its overseas
13 logistics and basing infrastructure to allow the PLA
14 to project and sustain military power at greater dis-
15 tances;
16 (2) a global PLA logistics network could give
17 the PRC increased capabilities to surveil or disrupt
18 United States military operations;
19 (3) in August 2017, the PRC officially opened
20 the first overseas PLA military base near the com-
21 mercial port of Doraleh in Djibouti;
22 (4) in 2019, the PRC also attempted to acquire
23 strategically important port infrastructure at Subic
24 Bay in the Philippines, but was stopped by the Gov-
25 ernments of the United States, the Philippines, and
26 Japan, and by private investors;
†S 2296 ES

1989
1 (5) in April 2025, officials from the PRC and
2 Cambodia officially inaugurated the China-Cambodia
3 Ream Naval Base Joint Support and Training Cen-
4 ter and celebrated the expansion of port facilities at
5 Ream Naval Base, some of which appear to have
6 been reserved for the use of PRC ships that have
7 been continuously stationed at Ream Naval Base
8 since December 2023; and
9 (6) in addition to the base in Djibouti and the
10 PRC’s access to the port at the Ream Naval Base
11 in Cambodia, the PRC is likely pursuing access to
12 additional military facilities to support naval, air,
13 and ground forces projection in many countries.
14 (c) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—While the executive
15 branch has undertaken case-by-case efforts to forestall the
16 establishment of new PRC permanent military presence
17 in several countries, it is the sense of Congress that future
18 efforts to counter the PRC’s global basing intentions
19 must—
20 (1) proceed with the urgency required to ad-
21 dress the strategic implications of the PRC’s actions;
22 (2) reflect sufficient interagency coordination
23 with respect to a problem that necessitates a whole-
24 of-government approach;
†S 2296 ES

1990
1 (3) ensure that the United States Government
2 maintains a proactive posture rather than a reactive
3 posture in order to maximize strategic decision
4 space;
5 (4) identify a comprehensive menu of actions
6 that would be influential in shaping a partner’s deci-
7 sion making regarding giving the PRC military ac-
8 cess to its sovereign territory;
9 (5) appropriately prioritize the subject of the
10 PRC’s global basing intentions within the context of
11 the overall United States strategic competition with
12 the PRC;
13 (6) consider how the PRC uses commercial and
14 scientific cooperation as a guise for establishing ac-
15 cess for the PLA and other PRC security forces in
16 foreign countries;
17 (7) factor in the potential contributions of key
18 allies and partners to help respond to the PRC’s
19 pursuit of global basing, many of which—
20 (A) have historic ties and influence in
21 many of the geographic areas the PRC is tar-
22 geting for potential future bases; and
23 (B) rely on the same basic intelligence pic-
24 ture to form our baseline understanding of the
25 PRC’s global intentions;
†S 2296 ES

1991
1 (8) establish and ensure sufficient resourcing
2 for enduring organizational structures and security
3 and foreign assistance and cooperation efforts to ef-
4 fectively address the issue of PRC global basing in-
5 tentions; and
6 (9) ensure that future force posture, freedom of
7 movement, and other interests of the United States
8 and our allies are not jeopardized by the continued
9 expansion of PRC bases.

SEC. 6252. FINDINGS.
8 Congress finds as follows:
9 (1) As enshrined in its Articles of Agreement,
10 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is devoted
11 to promoting international monetary cooperation, fa-
12 cilitating the expansion and balanced growth of
13 international trade, encouraging exchange stability,
14 and avoiding competitive exchange depreciation.
15 (2) Taiwan is the 21st largest economy in the
16 world and the 10th largest goods trading partner of
17 the United States.
18 (3) Although Taiwan is not an IMF member, it
19 is a member of the World Trade Organization, the
20 Asian Development Bank, and the Asia-Pacific Eco-
21 nomic Cooperation forum.
22 (4) According to the January 2020 Report on
23 Macroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of
24 Major Trading Partners of the United States, pub-
25 lished by the Department of the Treasury, Taiwan
†S 2296 ES

2006
1 held $471,900,000,000 in foreign exchange reserves,
2 more than major economies such as India, South
3 Korea, and Brazil.
4 (5) According to section 4(d) of the Taiwan Re-
5 lations Act (Public Law 96–8), enacted on April 10,
6 1979, ‘‘Nothing in this Act may be construed as a
7 basis for supporting the exclusion or expulsion of
8 Taiwan from continued membership in any inter-
9 national financial institution or any other inter-
10 national organization.’’.
11 (6) Taiwan held membership in the IMF for 9
12 years following the recognition of the People’s Re-
13 public of China (PRC) by the United Nations, and
14 16 Taiwan staff members at the Fund were allowed
15 to continue their employment after the PRC was
16 seated at the IMF in 1980. As James M. Boughton
17 has noted in his Silent Revolution: The International
18 Monetary Fund 1979–1989, even as the PRC was
19 seated, the United States Executive Director to the
20 IMF, Sam Y. Cross, expressed support on behalf of
21 the United States Government for ‘‘some kind of as-
22 sociation between Taiwan and the Fund’’.
23 (7) On September 27, 1994, in testimony be-
24 fore the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations re-
25 garding the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, then-As-
†S 2296 ES

2007
1 sistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
2 Affairs Winston Lord stated: ‘‘Recognizing Taiwan’s
3 important role in transnational issues, we will sup-
4 port its membership in organizations where state-
5 hood is not a prerequisite, and we will support op-
6 portunities for Taiwan’s voice to be heard in organi-
7 zations where its membership is not possible.’’.
8 (8) The Congress has repeatedly reaffirmed
9 support for this policy, including in Public Laws
10 107–10, 107–158, 108–28, 108–235, 113–17, and
11 114–139, and the unanimous House and Senate
12 passage of the Taiwan Allies International Protec-
13 tion and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of
14 2019.
15 (9) In its fact sheet, entitled ‘‘U.S. Relations
16 with Taiwan’’, published on August 31, 2018, the
17 Department of State asserts: ‘‘The United States
18 supports Taiwan’s membership in international orga-
19 nizations that do not require statehood as a condi-
20 tion of membership and encourages Taiwan’s mean-
21 ingful participation in international organizations
22 where its membership is not possible.’’.
23 (10) According to the Articles of Agreement of
24 the IMF, ‘‘membership shall be open to other coun-
†S 2296 ES

2008
1 tries’’, subject to conditions prescribed by the Board
2 of Governors of the IMF.
3 (11) In the IMF publication ‘‘Membership and
4 Nonmembership in the International Monetary
5 Fund: A Study in International Law and Organiza-
6 tion’’, Joseph Gold, the then-General Counsel and
7 Director of the Legal Department of the IMF, elabo-
8 rated on the differences between the terms ‘‘coun-
9 tries’’ and ‘‘states’’, noting that ‘‘the word ‘country’
10 may have been adopted because of the absence of
11 agreement on the definition of a ‘state’’’ and, with
12 respect to the use of ‘‘countries’’ and applications
13 for IMF membership, ‘‘the absence of any adjective
14 in the Articles emphasizes the breadth of the discre-
15 tion that the Fund may exercise in admitting coun-
16 tries to membership’’. According to Mr. Gold, ‘‘the
17 desire to give the Fund flexibility in dealing with ap-
18 plications may explain not only the absence of any
19 adjective that qualifies ‘countries’ but also the choice
20 of that word itself’’.
21 (12) In his IMF study, Mr. Gold further ob-
22 serves, ‘‘in the practice of the Fund the concepts of
23 independence and sovereignty have been avoided on
24 the whole as a mode of expressing a criterion for
25 membership in the Fund’’. He continues, ‘‘Although
†S 2296 ES

2009
1 the Fund usually takes into account the recognition
2 or nonrecognition of an entity as a state, there are
3 no rules or even informal understandings on the ex-
4 tent to which an applicant must have been recog-
5 nized by members or other international organiza-
6 tions before the Fund will regard it as eligible for
7 membership.’’. In fact, when considering an applica-
8 tion for membership where the status of an appli-
9 cant may not be resolved, Mr. Gold writes ‘‘there
10 have been occasions on which the Fund has made a
11 finding before decisions had been taken by the
12 United Nations or by most members or by members
13 with a majority of the total voting power.’’ Mr. Gold
14 concludes, ‘‘the Fund makes its own findings on
15 whether an applicant is a ‘country’, and makes them
16 solely for its own purposes.’’.
17 (13) Although not a member state of the
18 United Nations, the Republic of Kosovo is a member
19 of both the IMF and the World Bank, having joined
20 both organizations on June 29, 2009.
21 (14) On October 26, 2021, Secretary of State
22 Antony Blinken issued a statement in support of
23 Taiwan’s ‘‘robust, meaningful participation’’ in the
24 United Nations system, which includes the IMF, the
25 World Bank, and other specialized United Nations
†S 2296 ES

2010
1 agencies. Secretary of State Blinken noted, ‘‘As the
2 international community faces an unprecedented
3 number of complex and global issues, it is critical for
4 all stakeholders to help address these problems. This
5 includes the 24 million people who live in Taiwan.
6 Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the UN system
7 is not a political issue, but a pragmatic one.’’. He
8 continued, ‘‘Taiwan’s exclusion undermines the im-
9 portant work of the UN and its related bodies, all
10 of which stand to benefit greatly from its contribu-
11 tions.’’.
12 (15) In October 2024, Taiwan announced it
13 would seek IMF membership, with the Taipei Eco-
14 nomic and Cultural Representative Office in the
15 United States stating, ‘‘Taiwan’s membership at the
16 IMF would help boost financial resilience.’’.
17
SEC. 6253. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.
18 It is the sense of the Congress that—
19 (1) the size, significance, and connectedness of
20 the Taiwanese economy highlight the importance of
21 greater participation by Taiwan in the International
22 Monetary Fund, given the purposes of the Fund ar-
23 ticulated in its Articles of Agreement; and
24 (2) the experience of Taiwan in developing a vi-
25 brant and advanced economy under democratic gov-

SEC. 5202. INCREASING HOUSING IN OPPORTUNITY ZONES.
16 (a) COVERED GRANT DEFINED.—In this section, the
17 term ‘‘covered grant’’ means any competitive grant relat-
18 ing to the construction, modification, rehabilitation, or
19 preservation of housing, as determined by the Secretary
20 of Housing and Urban Development.
21 (b) PRIORITY.—When awarding a covered grant, the
22 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may give
23 additional weight to applicants located in, or that pri-
24 marily serve, a community that has been designated as
†S 2296 ES

2729
1 a qualified opportunity zone under section 1400Z–1 of the
2 Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

SEC. 5203. HOUSING SUPPLY FRAMEWORKS ACT.
4 (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
5 (1) The United States is facing a housing sup-
6 ply shortage. This housing supply shortage has re-
7 sulted in a record number of cost-burdened house-
8 holds across regions and spanning the large and
9 small cities, towns, and coastal and rural commu-
10 nities of the United States.
11 (2) Several factors contribute to the under-
12 supply of housing in the United States, particularly
13 workforce housing, including rising costs of con-
14 struction, a shortage of labor, supply chain disrup-
15 tions, and a lack of reliable funding sources.
16 (3) Regulatory barriers at the State and local
17 levels, such as zoning and land use regulations, also
18 inhibit the creation of new housing to meet local and
19 regional housing needs.
20 (4) State and local governments are proactively
21 exploring solutions for reforming regulatory barriers,
22 but additional resources, data, and models can help
23 adequately address these challenges.
24 (5) While land use regulation is the responsi-
25 bility of State and local governments, there is Fed-
†S 2296 ES

2730
1 eral support for necessary reforms, and there is an
2 opportunity for the Federal Government to provide
3 support and assistance to State and local govern-
4 ments that wish to undertake necessary reforms in
5 a manner that fits their communities’ needs.
6 (6) Therefore, zoning ordinances or systems of
7 land use regulation that have the intent or effect of
8 restricting housing opportunities based on economic
9 status or income without interests that are substan-
10 tial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory and that outweigh
11 the regional need for housing are contrary to the re-
12 gional and national interest.
13 (b) DEFINITIONS.—In this section:
14 (1) AFFORDABLE HOUSING.—The term ‘‘afford-
15 able housing’’ means housing for which the monthly
16 payment is not more than 30 percent of the monthly
17 income of the household.
18 (2) ASSISTANT SECRETARY.—The term ‘‘Assist-
19 ant Secretary’’ means the Assistant Secretary for
20 Policy Development and Research of the Depart-
21 ment of Housing and Urban Development.
22 (3) LOCAL ZONING FRAMEWORK.—The term
23 ‘‘local zoning framework’’ means the local zoning
24 codes and other ordinances, procedures, and policies
25 governing zoning and land-use at the local level.
†S 2296 ES

2731
1 (4) SECRETARY.—The term ‘‘Secretary’’ means
2 the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
3 (5) STATE ZONING FRAMEWORK.—The term

7 the United States, enabling local planning and zon-
8 ing authorities and establishing and guiding related
9 policies and programs.

SEC. 5106. PROMOTING REUTILIZATION OF LANGUAGE
15
SKILLS IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE.
16 (a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
17 gress that—
18 (1) foreign language skills are essential to effec-
19 tive diplomacy, particularly in high-priority posi-
20 tions, such as Chinese- and Russian-language des-
21 ignated positions focused on the People’s Republic of
22 China and Russia;
23 (2) reutilization of acquired language skills cre-
24 ates efficiencies through the reduction of language
25 training overall and increases regional expertise;
†S 2296 ES

3039
1 (3) often, investments in language skills are not
2 sufficiently utilized and maintained throughout the
3 careers of members of the Foreign Service following
4 an initial assignment after language training;
5 (4) providing incentives or requirements to se-
6 lect ‘‘out-year bidders’’ for priority language-des-
7 ignated assignments would decrease training costs
8 overall and encourage more expertise in relevant pri-
9 ority areas; and
10 (5) incentives for members of the Foreign Serv-
11 ice to not only acquire and retain, but reuse, foreign
12 language skills in priority assignments would reduce
13 training costs in terms of both time and money and
14 increase regional expertise to improve abilities in
15 those areas deemed high priority by the Secretary.
16 (b) INCENTIVES TO REUTILIZE LANGUAGE
17 SKILLS.—Section 704(b)(3) of the Foreign Service Act of
18 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4024(b)(3)) is amended by inserting
19 ‘‘and reutilize’’ after ‘‘to acquire or retain proficiency in’’.

SEC. 5305. COMMERCIAL SPYWARE.
20 (a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
21 gress that—
22 (1) there is a national security need for the le-
23 gitimate and responsible procurement and applica-
24 tion of cyber intrusion capabilities, including efforts
†S 2296 ES

3058
1 related to counterterrorism, counternarcotics, and
2 countertrafficking;
3 (2) the growing commercial market for sophisti-
4 cated cyber intrusion capabilities has enhanced state
5 and non-state actors’ abilities to target and track for
6 nefarious purposes individuals, such as journalists,
7 human rights defenders, members of civil society
8 groups, members of ethnic or religious minority
9 groups, and others for exercising their human rights
10 and fundamental freedoms, or the family members
11 of these targeted individuals;
12 (3) the proliferation of commercial spyware pre-
13 sents significant and growing risks to United States
14 national security, including to the safety and secu-
15 rity of United States Government personnel; and
16 (4) ease of access into and lack of transparency
17 in the commercial spyware market raises the prob-
18 ability of spreading potentially destructive or disrup-
19 tive cyber capabilities to a wider range of malicious
20 actors.
21 (b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the
22 United States—
23 (1) to oppose the misuse of commercial spyware
24 to target individuals, including journalists, defenders
25 of internationally recognized human rights, and
†S 2296 ES

3059
1 members of civil society groups, members of ethnic
2 or religious minority groups, and others for exer-
3 cising their internationally recognized human rights
4 and fundamental freedoms, or the family members
5 of these targeted individuals;
6 (2) to coordinate with allies and partners to
7 prevent the export of commercial spyware tools to
8 end-users likely to use them for malicious activities;
9 (3) to maintain robust information-sharing with
10 trusted allies and partners on commercial spyware
11 proliferation and misuse, including to better identify
