  "harm_narrative": {
    "primary_claim": "Lack of transparent pricing data allows large agribusiness corporations to engage in price manipulation, resulting in suppressed farm income and reduced market competition",

    "case_1": {
      "title": "Dairy Price Suppression (2023)",
      "description": "Major dairy processors reported record profits while dairy farmers received lowest prices in a decade. Lack of transparent pricing data prevented farmers from negotiating fair contracts.",
      "impact": "2,500 dairy farms closed in 2023, highest rate in 15 years",
      "data_gap": "Farmers lack access to processor margin data, making it impossible to verify if low prices reflect market conditions or profit manipulation"
    },
    "case_2": {
      "title": "Cattle Market Distortion (2024)",
      "description": "Meatpackers restricted cattle supply through strategic plant closures and production limits, creating artificial scarcity that raised retail prices while suppressing cattle prices",
      "impact": "Cattle ranchers received 30% less per head while consumers paid 25% more at grocery store",
      "data_gap": "No requirement to report production capacity utilization, making strategic supply restrictions invisible"
    }

  "economic_mechanisms": {
    "information_asymmetry": {
      "problem": "Large processors have access to comprehensive market data through industry associations and private data services. Farmers have access only to USDA aggregate reports, which lack timeliness and granularity.",
      "consequence": "Processors can time purchases and contracts to maximize their margins at farmer expense"
    },
    "market_power": {
      "problem": "Concentrated processing industry gives few buyers power over many sellers (monopsony)",
      "consequence": "Without transparent pricing, farmers cannot verify if offered prices reflect true market value or exercise of market power"
    },
    "contract_terms": {
      "problem": "Many agricultural contracts contain confidentiality clauses preventing price disclosure",
      "consequence": "Individual farmers cannot compare contracts or negotiate from informed position"
    }
  },
  "opposition_arguments": {
    "opp_argument_1": {
      "claim": "Transparency requirements will reveal proprietary business information, harming competitive advantage",
      "refutation": "Bill requires aggregated, market-level data only - no individual company proprietary information. Similar transparency exists in securities markets without harming competition.",
      "evidence": "Futures markets require position reporting without revealing proprietary trading strategies"
    },
    "opp_argument_2": {
      "claim": "Market concentration reflects efficiency, not market power abuse",
      "refutation": "Academic research shows processing margins increased faster than costs, indicating market power, not efficiency gains",
      "evidence": "USDA Economic Research Service analysis (2024) found processor margins grew 45% while input costs grew 12%"
