## ⚠️ RISK MANAGEMENT

### Risk 1: Legislative Timeline Delay

**Risk:** NDAA amendment fails or delayed to next cycle

**Mitigation:**
- Multiple legislative vehicles (standalone bill, other authorizations)
- Agency rulemaking as alternative (if legislative fails)
- State-level framework as backup
- Long-term strategy (not dependent on single cycle)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If NDAA fails, pursue standalone bill
- If standalone fails, pursue agency rulemaking
- If federal fails, pursue state-level framework

---

### Risk 2: Insurance Industry Resistance

**Risk:** Insurers resist premium credits, prefer status quo

**Mitigation:**
- Frame as voluntary (insurers choose to offer credits)
- Demonstrate actuarial benefits (lower claims)
- Engage early with supportive insurers
- Show competitive advantage (first movers)

**Contingency Plan:**
- Focus on supportive insurers first
- Build momentum with early adopters
- Demonstrate ROI with pilot programs

---

### Risk 3: Technology Qualification Challenges

**Risk:** Wireless power fails to qualify or qualification is delayed

**Mitigation:**
- Strong actuarial analysis (15-30% risk reduction)
- Engineering validation (site surveys, uptime data)
- Clear documentation of battery elimination benefits
- Early engagement with certifying agency

**Contingency Plan:**
- Address qualification concerns proactively
- Provide additional validation data if needed
- Engage engineering experts for site surveys

---

### Risk 4: Regulatory Complexity

**Risk:** Certification framework becomes too complex, slowing adoption

**Mitigation:**
- Start with simple, quantitative standards
- Pilot program to test framework
- Iterative improvement based on feedback
- Clear documentation and guidance

**Contingency Plan:**
- Simplify framework if complexity becomes barrier
- Provide extensive guidance and support
- Streamline application process
