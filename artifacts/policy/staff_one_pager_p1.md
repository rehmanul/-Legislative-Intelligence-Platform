# Wireless Power & Sensor Uptime: FY26 Execution Opportunity

**Date:** January 2026  
**Bill Authority:** S.2296 - NDAA FY2026  
**Priority Sections:** P1 (Immediate Action)

---

## Problem Statement

Defense facilities face three operational challenges that impact readiness and cost:

1. **Battery Maintenance Burden:** Security systems, IoT sensors, and digital displays require frequent battery replacement, creating maintenance costs and operational downtime.

2. **Sensor Downtime:** Battery-powered devices experience downtime during replacement cycles, reducing monitoring coverage and data continuity.

3. **Energy Waste:** Battery production, disposal, and replacement processes consume resources and create waste streams.
